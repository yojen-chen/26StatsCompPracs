## Practical Four

set up:

```{r}
# Install tidyverse if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("tidyverse")
}
library(tidyverse)

# Install and load nycflights13 for flight data
if (!requireNamespace("nycflights13", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("nycflights13")
}
library(nycflights13)

```

### Question 1:

```{r}
glimpse(flights)
```

### Question 2:

original codes:

```{r}
flight1 <- flights[flights$month == 1, ]
carrier_vec <- unique(flight1$carrier)
carrier_dist_vec_mean <- numeric(length(carrier_vec))
carrier_dist_vec_sd <- numeric(length(carrier_vec))
for (i in seq_along(carrier_vec)) {
  carrier_dist_vec_mean[i] <- mean(
    flight1$distance[flight1$carrier == carrier_vec[i]]
   )
  carrier_dist_vec_sd[i] <- sd(
    flight1$distance[flight1$carrier == carrier_vec[i]]
  )
}
dist_tbl <- tibble(
  carrier = carrier_vec,
  mean_distance = carrier_dist_vec_mean,
  sd_distance = carrier_dist_vec_sd
)
dist_tbl[order(dist_tbl$mean_distance), ]
```

##rewrite using dplyr and the pipe:

```{r}
dist_summary <- flights |> 
                    filter(month == 1) |> 
                    group_by(carrier) |> 
                    summarise(mean_distance = mean(distance), sd_distance = sd(distance)) |> 
                    arrange(mean_distance)
print(dist_summary)
```

### Question 3:

Explain why the standard deviation is `NA` for one carrier, and why it is `0` for others. Demonstrate your answer using code.

```{r}
sd_zero <- dist_summary |> filter(sd_distance == 0) |> select(carrier, sd_distance)
sd_na <- dist_summary |> filter(is.na(sd_distance)) |> select(carrier, sd_distance)

flights |> 
  filter(month == 1) |> 
  filter(carrier %in% c("OO", "YV", "F9", "AS", "HA")) |> 
  group_by(carrier, distance) |> 
  summarise(observations = n(), .groups = "drop")

```

The standard deviation for OO is NA because there is only one observation. And is 0 for AS, F9, HA, and YV because all observations are equal for each carrier.

### Question 4:

Using `tidyr` and `dplyr` where appropriate, construct a dataframe where the carriers are along the columns, and the rows are the average departure delay (`dep_delay`) flown by each carrier (`carrier`) in each month.

```{r}
flights |> 
  group_by(month, carrier) |> 
  summarise(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = carrier, values_from = avg_dep_delay)
```

### Question 5:

Calculate the proportion of flights that were delayed (`dep_delay` greater than 0) but arrived on or before time (`arr_delay` less than or equal to 0).

```{r}
flights |> 
  summarise(proportion = mean(dep_delay > 0 & arr_delay <= 0, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### Question 6:

##Identify routes that have more than one airline flies

```{r}
routes <- flights |> 
            group_by(origin, dest) |> 
            summarise(num_carriers = n_distinct(carrier), .groups = "drop") |> 
            filter(num_carriers > 1)
routes
```

##For each such route, calculate the average arrival delay for each airline (exclude NAs). Find the names of these airlines.

```{r}
avg_delays <- flights |> 
                inner_join(routes, by = c("origin", "dest")) |>
                group_by(origin, dest, carrier) |> 
                summarise(avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm =TRUE), .groups = "drop") |> 
                inner_join(airlines, by = "carrier") |> 
                relocate(Airline_name = name, .before = avg_arr_delay)
avg_delays
```

##For each such route, identify the airline with the worst and best average arrival delay.

```{r}
best_worst <- avg_delays |> 
  group_by(origin, dest) |> 
  summarise(worst_airline = Airline_name[which.max(avg_arr_delay)],
            worst_arr_delay = max(avg_arr_delay),
            best_airline = Airline_name[which.min(avg_arr_delay)],
            best_arr_delay = min(avg_arr_delay),
            .groups = "drop")
best_worst
```

##Identify the route with the greatest difference between the best and worst performing airlines.

```{r}
greatest_diff <- best_worst |> 
  group_by(origin, dest) |>
  mutate(diff = worst_arr_delay - best_arr_delay) |> 
  arrange(desc(diff))
head(greatest_diff, n=1)
```

##Determine the reason for this difference

```{r}
flights |> 
  filter(origin == "JFK", dest == "ATL") |> 
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(num_flights = n(),avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") |> 
  relocate(carrier, name)
```

ExpressJet Airlines Inc. has only flown once on this route, from JFK to ATL, and this large difference is due to it being delayed by 2 hours and 4 minutes whereas Endeavor has flown 55 times with an average departure delay of only 1 minutes. This is not a very good indication of whether ExpressJet Airlines Inc. is a bad airline since there is only 1 observation.

### Question 7:

Identify all columns with missing entries, typos and any other inconsistencies in the dataset below (load it just by running the code; created using `dput` command, FYI):

```{r}
#| echo: false
df <- structure(list(id = c("id_1", "id_2", "id_3", "id_4", "id_5", 
"id_6", "id_7", "id_8", "id_9", "id_10", "id_11", "id_12", "id_13",
