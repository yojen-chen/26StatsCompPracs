## Part 1:

```{r}
airquality
rows_with_na <- airquality[rowSums(is.na(airquality))>0, ]
rows_with_na
```

\*solutions:

```{r}
# How do I know if something is na: is.na()
df <-  airquality

naRows <- c()
for (r in 1:nrow(df)){
  for (col in 1:ncol(df)){
    if (is.na(df[r, col])){
      naRows <- c(naRows, r)
      break
    }
  }
}
print(naRows)
```

## Part 2:

```{r}
mean(airquality$Temp)
sd(airquality$Temp)
min(airquality$Temp)
max(airquality$Temp)

mean(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
min(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
max(airquality$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Part 3:

```{r}
x <- cbind(1, cars$speed)
y <- cars$dist

beta <- solve(t(x)%*%x)%*%t(x)%*%y
beta
```

## Part 4:

```{r}
model <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
summary(model)
```
